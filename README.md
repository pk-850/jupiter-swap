Plain HTML file that imports the terminal via CDN.

Uses the [create-solana-dapp](https://github.com/solana-developers/create-solana-dapp) template to create a new project, then imports the terminal via CDN.

## Wakatime report
Here's how long it took to me to make this and how I spent that time. Does **NOT** include time spent on ChatGPT/Perplexity/Jupiter docs cuz I forgot to update the list of logged sites.
