# jupiter-swap
An implementation of the Jupiter Swap API - here's a video walkthrough of all this code: [Integrate Jupiter Swap in 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LzvOSgR5DU)

## Usage
The code in this repo is a reference imeplementation, it's not built for direct usage.

- Get an API key from Helius - https://www.helius.dev/
- Add your key to the the HTML OR create-solana-dapp implementation

I recommend watching the video linked above to get an idea of the layout of the code and how the Jupiter swap API works.
 
### HTML
Plain HTML file that imports the terminal via CDN. 

### Create-solana-dapp
Uses the [create-solana-dapp](https://github.com/solana-developers/create-solana-dapp) template to create a new project, then imports the terminal via CDN.
